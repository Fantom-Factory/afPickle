Overview [#overview]
********
A simple API that pickles Plain Old Fantom Objects to and from strings.

Pickle is a drop-in replacement for the standard [Fantom serialisation framework]`docLang::Serialization`. It fixes many bugs, adds new features, and in general, *just works!*

Pickle only enhancements:
 - Pretty printing is event prettier (and enabled by default).
 - Object creation may be handed off to a dedicated func via new 'makeObjFn' option.
 - Pickled objects may omit 'null' values via new 'skipNulls' option.
 - Pickled objects may emit 'using' statements via new 'using' option, to reduce verbosity and cut down file size.
 - Fully tested in Java AND Javascript.

Pickle fixes the following:
 - [@2758]`https://fantom.org/forum/topic/2758` - It-block ctors are used if they exist.
 - [@2726]`https://fantom.org/forum/topic/2726` - Nested Maps are possible in JS.
 - [@2669]`https://fantom.org/forum/topic/2669` - Maps are ordered as after de-serialisation.
 - [@2644]`https://fantom.org/forum/topic/2644` - Optimised serialisation when using the 'skipDefaults' option.

The Pickle source code mostly **IS** the standard *Fantom serialisation framework*! The framework has been liberated into its own library to guard against it being [deleted from the Fantom code base]`https://fantom.org/forum/topic/2758#c3` and to make much needed updates and adjustments.

Pickle contains native implementations for both Java and Javascript.



Quickstart [#quickstart]
**********
pre>
syntax: fantom
str := Pickle.writeObj(Gerkin())
  // -->
  // "acme::Gerkin {
  //      name="Rick"
  //  }"

juicy := (Gerkin) Pickle.readObj(str)
echo(juicy.name)  // -> Rick

...

class Gerkin {
    Str name := "Rick"
}
<pre



Usage [#usage]
*****
Pickle is a drop-in replacement for the standard [Fantom serialisation framework]`docLang::Serialization`. Pickle is essentially one class with a 'read' method and a 'write' method for pickling your objects. Both methods may take an options Map to alter their behaviour.



Read Options [#readOptions]
============

makeArgs [#makeArgs]
--------
A List of arguments that passed to the root object's make constructor via 'Type.make'. These arguments may be passed *in addition* to a trailing it-block arg.

pre>
syntax: fantom

Pickle.readObj(str, [
    "makeArgs" : Str["green"]
])

...

class Gerkin {
    Str name
    Str colour

    new make(Str colour, |This| f) {
        f(this)
        this.colour = colour
    }
}
<pre

Default is 'null'.



makeObjFn [#makeObjFn]
---------
All object creation may be delegated to a dedicated function.

pre>
syntax: fantom

Pickle.readObj(str, [
    "makeObjFn" : |Type type, Field:Obj? fieldVals->Obj?| {
        // BeanBuilder auto selects an appropiate ctor regardless of name
        afBeanUtils::BeanBuilder.build(type, vals)
    }
])
<pre

Default is 'null'.



Write Options [#writeOptions]
=============

indent [#indent]
------
May be an 'Int' or a 'Str'. 'Int' specifies the number of spaces to indent each level while a 'Str' specifies the actual indent. This makes the follow two examples identical.

pre>
syntax: fantom
str1 := Pickle.writeObj(obj, ["indent" : 2])

str2 := Pickle.writeObj(obj, ["indent" : "  "])
<pre

Indenting / pretty printing is on by default, becasue you're creating a *human readable* document - if that's not your intent, consider using some other 'b1n4ry' serialisation instead!

Default is '"\t"'.



skipDefaults [#skipDefaults]
------------
Specifies if we should skip fields at their default values.  Field values are compared according to the 'equals' method.

Pickling with 'skipDefaults' requires a little more overhead as a default value of each type instance needs to be created for comparison. Consider using 'skipNulls' instead.

Default is 'false'.



skipErrors [#skipErrors]
----------
Specifies if we should skip objects which aren't serializable. If 'true' then 'null' is output with an accompanying comment.

Default is 'false'.



skipNulls [#skipNulls]
---------
Specifies if we should skip fields with 'null' values. 'null' is a common default value and rarely adds value to a serialised document.

Default is 'false'.



using [#using]
-----
List of pod names that are emitted in 'using' statements at the top of the serialised document. Types from said pods are then emitted with their basic names, not their qualified names.

This often makes the serialised documents smaller, less verbose, and easier to read.

pre>
syntax: fantom
Pickle.writeObj(Str:Int[:])
  // --> [sys::Str:sys::Int][:]

Pickle.writeObj(Str:Int[:], ["using":["sys"]])
  // --> using sys
  //     [Str:Int][:]


Pickle.writeObj(Str:Int[:], ["using":"sys xml"])
  // --> using sys
  // --> using xml
  //     [Str:Int][:]
<pre

The 'using' option may also be a string of *space separated values*.

Default is 'Str[,]'.
